# Cert Manager

[cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) is a native Kubernetes certificate management controller. It can help with issuing certificates from a variety of sources, such as Letâ€™s Encrypt, HashiCorp Vault, Venafi, a simple signing key pair, or self signed.

## TL;DR

```console
$ helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
$ helm install my-release bitnami/cert-manager
```

## Introduction

Bitnami charts for Helm are carefully engineered, actively maintained and are the quickest and easiest way to deploy containers on a Kubernetes cluster that are ready to handle production workloads.

This chart bootstraps a [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) Deployment in a [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io) cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager.

Bitnami charts can be used with [Kubeapps](https://kubeapps.com/) for deployment and management of Helm Charts in clusters. This Helm chart has been tested on top of [Bitnami Kubernetes Production Runtime](https://kubeprod.io/) (BKPR). Deploy BKPR to get automated TLS certificates, logging and monitoring for your applications.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.12+
- Helm 3.1.0
- PV provisioner support in the underlying infrastructure

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:

```console
$ helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
$ helm install my-release bitnami/cert-manager
```

> **Tip**: List all releases using `helm list`

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `my-release` helm release:

```console
$ helm uninstall my-release
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.

## Upgrading

```bash
$ helm upgrade my-release bitnami/cert-manager
```
